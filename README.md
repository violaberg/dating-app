### **Intro**
SparkSync is a modern dating application designed to help people form meaningful connections through shared interests, preferences, and compatibility matching. The platform emphasizes authentic interactions and provides a safe, engaging environment for users to meet potential partners.

### **Deployment**

[Kanban board](https://github.com/users/violaberg/projects/12)

### **Goal**
The primary goal of SparkSync is to create a digital dating platform that excels in:

*   **Meaningful Connections:** Fostering genuine relationships, not just superficial interactions.
*   **User Safety:**  Prioritizing user safety through robust security measures and a trustworthy environment.
*   **Inclusivity:**  Creating a welcoming space for users of all backgrounds, genders, and sexual orientations.
*   **Accessibility:**  Providing a user-friendly and intuitive experience for everyone.


### **Problem Statement**
Traditional dating apps often fall short in several key areas:

*   **Superficiality:**  Overemphasis on physical appearance, leading to shallow connections.
*   **Safety Concerns:** Insufficient verification and safety protocols, exposing users to risks.
*   **Lack of Inclusivity:**  Not catering to the diverse needs and preferences of all users.
*   **Ineffective Matching:**  Poorly designed algorithms that result in mismatched connections and user dissatisfaction.
*   **Poor User Experience:** Confusing interfaces and difficult navigation, hindering the overall experience.



### **Objective(s)**

*   **Develop a robust matching algorithm:** Utilize user-provided data (questionnaire responses, preferences, and profile information) to connect individuals with high compatibility potential.
*   **Implement strong security features:** Include profile verification, reporting mechanisms, and data encryption to ensure user safety and data protection.
*   **Design an intuitive and accessible user interface:**  Create a clean, user-friendly design across all application pages that is accessible and enjoyable to use.
*   **Foster a welcoming and inclusive community:** Promote respectful interactions and provide a platform that is inclusive of all users, regardless of background, gender, or sexual orientation.
*   **Enable customizable and detailed user profiles:** Allow users to fully express their individuality and preferences through comprehensive profile fields.
*   **Provide multiple communication channels:** Offer a contact form for user inquiries and support, with a plan for future in-app chat functionality for matched users.

### **Target Audience**
SparkSync is designed for adults (18+) seeking various types of connections, including:

*   **Individuals Seeking Long-Term Relationships:** Those looking for committed, lasting partnerships.
*   **People Interested in Casual Dating:**  Users who want to meet new people and explore connections without immediate long-term commitments.
*   **Tech-Savvy Individuals:**  People comfortable using online platforms and apps for social interaction.
*   **Users Who Value Safety and Privacy:** Individuals who prioritize a secure and trustworthy online dating experience.
*   **Newcomers to Online Dating:**  The intuitive design makes it easy for those unfamiliar with online dating to get started.
* **Hopeless romantics:** Providing an experience that goes further than surface level.
